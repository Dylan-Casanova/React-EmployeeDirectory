## Employee-Directory

Employee-Directory is an application that allows users to look up any employee on the directory.<br>
This can be done by typing the employees name on the search bar. users can also filter employees by clicking next to the any column name.<br>

This is what the initial screen looks like<br>
![initialScreen](./src/assets/1.png) <br>

After we start typing an employee name, we can see that the table only displays employees with matching results <br>

## Technologies used 
I enjoyed working on this app because I got the opportunity to implement new technologies like AG-Grid. <br>
The table was created with Ag-Grid, which made table creating process smooth and efficient. <br>
